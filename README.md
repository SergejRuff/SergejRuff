# Sergej Ruff

**`Data Science/Bioinformatics Enthusiast`**


Hi there, I'm Sergej. I'm a data scientist interested in statistics, bioinformatics, and biology. But hey, I'm not all about crunching numbers—I'm also a gamer, a bookworm, and I love going to the gym.

Lately, I've been diving into the exciting worlds of machine learning/AI and transcriptomics, particularly focusing on single-cell analysis.


## Education:

- Completed Bachelor's degree in Biology at Leibniz Universität Hannover.
- Master's degree in Biomedical Data Science at Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.
